  title={Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature},
  author={Adachi, Masaki and Fujisawa, Masahiro and Osborne, Michael A},
  pages={1--11},
  abstract={Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators---specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation---both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, potentially resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance. To address this, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.},

  title={A Dictionary of Closed-Form Kernel Mean Embeddings},
  author={Briol, Francois-Xavier and Karvonen, Toni and Gessner, Alexandra and Mahsereci, Maren},
  pages={84--94},
  abstract={Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in other computational tools for numerical integration or methods for statistical inference. These methods often require, or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the embeddings.},

  title={Solving {E}instein's equations as {B}ayesian inference},
  author={Ceuster, Frederik De and Colemont, Tom and Li, Tjonnie G.F.},
  pages={131--137},
  abstract={Gravitational waves (GWs) are revolutionising our fundamental understanding of physics and cosmology. However, the numerical modelling required to turn their measurements into scientific detections poses a formidable computational challenge. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of probabilistic numerics (PN) to model GW sources. As a proof-of-principle, we pose the solution of the Einstein equations, which relate the dynamics of spacetime to its matter content, as a Bayesian inference problem. Using a fixed-point iteration scheme and iterative linearisation, we show that the non-linear problem can be divided into a set of consecutively solvable Bayesian linear regression problems. As a first application, we use this approach to solve the spacetime geometry inside a static and spherically-symmetric neutron star. We conclude that PN provides a promising approach to overcome some of the computational challenges in GW science.},

  title={Learning to Solve Related Linear Systems},
  author={Hegde, Disha and Cockayne, Jon},
  pages={103--121},
  abstract={Solving multiple parametrised related systems is an essential component of many numerical tasks, and learning from the already solved systems will make this process faster. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.},

  title={Online Conformal Probabilistic Numerics via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Offloading},
  author={Hou, Qiushuo and Park, Sangwoo and Zecchin, Matteo and Cai, Yunlong and Yu, Guanding and Simeone, Osvaldo},
  pages={138--146},
  abstract={Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions. Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.},

  title={{B}ayesian autoregression to optimize temporal {M}at\'{e}rn kernel {G}aussian process hyperparameters},
  author={Kouw, Wouter M.},
  pages={122--130},
  abstract={Gaussian processes are important models in the field of probabilistic numerics. We present a procedure for optimizing Mat\'{e}rn kernel temporal Gaussian processes with respect to the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters. It is based on casting the optimization problem as a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for the parameters of an autoregressive model. We demonstrate that the proposed procedure outperforms maximizing the marginal likelihood as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, both in terms of runtime and ultimate root mean square error in Gaussian process regression.},

  title={Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements},
  author={Kr\"{a}mer, Nicholas},
  pages={12--24},
  abstract={Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations$-$unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.},

  title={Natural Evolutionary Search meets Probabilistic Numerics},
  author={Osselin, Pierre and Adachi, Masaki and Dong, Xiaowen and Osborne, Michael A},
  pages={50--74},
  abstract={Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks. However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates, NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.},

  title={Effects of Interpolation Error and Bias on the Random Mesh Finite Element Method for Inverse Problems},
  author={Poot, Anne and Rocha, Iuri and Kerfriden, Pierre and Meer, Frans van der},
  pages={95--102},
  abstract={Bayesian inverse problems are an important application for probabilistic solvers of partial differential equations: when fully resolving numerical error is computationally infeasible, probabilistic solvers can be used to consistently model the error and propagate it to the posterior. In this work, the performance of the random mesh finite element method (RM-FEM) is investigated in a Bayesian inverse setting. We show how interpolation error negatively affects the RM-FEM posterior, and how these negative effects can be diminished. In scenarios where FEM is biased for a quantity of interest, we find that RM-FEM struggles to accurately model this bias.},

  title={Fast {G}aussian process regression for high dimensional functions with derivative information},
  author={Sorokin, Aleksei and Robbe, Pieterjan and Hickernell, Fred J},
  pages={35--49},
  abstract={Gaussian process regression (GPR) is the backbone of many methods in probabilistic numerics. Exact GPR on $n$ sampling locations in $d$ dimensions generally requires $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage and costs $\mathcal{O}(n^3+dn^2)$ to fit assuming kernel evaluation costs $\mathcal{O}(d)$. Using certain pairings of sampling locations and kernels induces nice structure into the Gram matrix and enables accelerated exact GPR. One popular pairing uses Cartesian grids with product kernels to induce Kronecker structure in the Gram matrix. This reduces exact GP fitting costs to $\mathcal{O}(d n^{3/d})$ and storage requirements to $\mathcal{O}(d n^{2/d})$, but quickly becomes intractable when the dimension exceeds a few dozen. Recent work has shown that pairings certain low discrepancy sequences with special kernels enables GPR to scale like $\mathcal{O}(n \log n + nd)$ for fitting costs and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for storage requirements. We describe an extension of these methods to problems which observe $m$ derivative multi-indices at each of the $n$ low discrepancy sampling locations. By exploiting similar structure across blocks of the Gram matrix, we are able to reduce the GP fitting cost from $\mathcal{O}(n^3 m^3 + n^2m^2d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m^2 n \log n+m^3n + n m^2 d)$ and reduce the storage requirements from $\mathcal{O}(n^2 m^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$. We explore a number of synthetic benchmarks to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.},

  title={Randomised Postiterations for Calibrated {B}ayesCG},
  author={Vyas, Niall and Hegde, Disha and Cockayne, Jon},
  pages={75--83},
  abstract={The Bayesian conjugate gradient method offers probabilistic solutions to linear systems but suffers from poor calibration, limiting its utility in uncertainty quantification tasks. Recent approaches leveraging postiterations to construct priors have improved computational properties but failed to correct calibration issues. In this work, we propose a novel randomised postiteration strategy that enhances the calibration of the BayesCG posterior while preserving its favourable convergence characteristics. We present theoretical guarantees for the improved calibration, supported by results on the distribution of posterior errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the method in both synthetic and inverse problem settings, showing enhanced uncertainty quantification and better propagation of uncertainties through computational pipelines.},

  title={Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers},
  author={Yao, Dingling and Tronarp, Filip and Bosch, Nathanael},
  pages={25--34},
  abstract={Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.},
