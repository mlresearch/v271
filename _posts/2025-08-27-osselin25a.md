title: Natural Evolutionary Search meets Probabilistic Numerics
abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving real-valued
  black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution Strategies (NES)
  represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for scenarios where prior
  distributions are available. By optimising the objective function in the space of
  search distributions, NES algorithms naturally integrate prior knowledge during
  initialisation, making them effective in settings such as semi-supervised learning
  and user-prior belief frameworks. However, due to their reliance on random sampling
  and Monte Carlo estimates, NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
  Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework with
  Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently outperforms their
  non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample efficient methods such as
  Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide range of tasks, including benchmark
  test functions, data-driven optimisation tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning
  tasks and locomotion tasks.
