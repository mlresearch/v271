title: Learning to Solve Related Linear Systems
abstract: Solving multiple parametrised related systems is an essential component
  of many numerical tasks, and learning from the already solved systems will make
  this process faster. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver
  over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems
  in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We
  advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate
  gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and
  covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design
  choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of
  using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.
