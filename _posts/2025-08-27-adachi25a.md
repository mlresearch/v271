title: Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by
  Kernel Quadrature
abstract: Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models,
  their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely
  used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper
  scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that
  popular CRPS estimators—specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in
  the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation—both
  exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, potentially
  resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance. To address this,
  we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator
  and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach
  consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.
