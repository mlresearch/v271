title: Solving Einstein’s equations as Bayesian inference
abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are revolutionising our fundamental understanding
  of physics and cosmology. However, the numerical modelling required to turn their
  measurements into scientific detections poses a formidable computational challenge.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of probabilistic numerics (PN) to model
  GW sources. As a proof-of-principle, we pose the solution of the Einstein equations,
  which relate the dynamics of spacetime to its matter content, as a Bayesian inference
  problem. Using a fixed-point iteration scheme and iterative linearisation, we show
  that the non-linear problem can be divided into a set of consecutively solvable
  Bayesian linear regression problems. As a first application, we use this approach
  to solve the spacetime geometry inside a static and spherically-symmetric neutron
  star. We conclude that PN provides a promising approach to overcome some of the
  computational challenges in GW science.
