title: Bayesian autoregression to optimize temporal Matérn kernel Gaussian process
  hyperparameters
abstract: Gaussian processes are important models in the field of probabilistic numerics.
  We present a procedure for optimizing Matérn kernel temporal Gaussian processes
  with respect to the kernel covariance function’s hyperparameters. It is based on
  casting the optimization problem as a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for
  the parameters of an autoregressive model. We demonstrate that the proposed procedure
  outperforms maximizing the marginal likelihood as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
  sampling, both in terms of runtime and ultimate root mean square error in Gaussian
  process regression.
