title: Effects of Interpolation Error and Bias on the Random Mesh Finite Element Method
  for Inverse Problems
abstract: 'Bayesian inverse problems are an important application for probabilistic
  solvers of partial differential equations: when fully resolving numerical error
  is computationally infeasible, probabilistic solvers can be used to consistently
  model the error and propagate it to the posterior. In this work, the performance
  of the random mesh finite element method (RM-FEM) is investigated in a Bayesian
  inverse setting. We show how interpolation error negatively affects the RM-FEM posterior,
  and how these negative effects can be diminished. In scenarios where FEM is biased
  for a quantity of interest, we find that RM-FEM struggles to accurately model this
  bias.'
