title: A Dictionary of Closed-Form Kernel Mean Embeddings
abstract: Kernel mean embeddings – integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability
  distribution – are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in other
  computational tools for numerical integration or methods for statistical inference.
  These methods often require, or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form
  expression for the kernel mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can
  be challenging, limiting the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners
  do not have access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation
  by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along with
  practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also provide a Python
  library that includes minimal implementations of the embeddings.
