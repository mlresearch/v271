title: Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements
abstract: 'Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with
  adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations$-$unless
  we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want
  the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself:
  Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine’s capabilities, making
  our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity
  would abandon years of progress, which can’t be the answer. In this work, we solve
  this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands
  building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method
  (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations
  by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes
  adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.'
