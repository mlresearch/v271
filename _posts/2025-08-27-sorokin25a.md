title: Fast Gaussian process regression for high dimensional functions with derivative
  information
abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is the backbone of many methods in probabilistic
  numerics. Exact GPR on $n$ sampling locations in $d$ dimensions generally requires
  $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage and costs $\mathcal{O}(n^3+dn^2)$ to fit assuming kernel
  evaluation costs $\mathcal{O}(d)$. Using certain pairings of sampling locations
  and kernels induces nice structure into the Gram matrix and enables accelerated
  exact GPR. One popular pairing uses Cartesian grids with product kernels to induce
  Kronecker structure in the Gram matrix. This reduces exact GP fitting costs to $\mathcal{O}(d
  n^{3/d})$ and storage requirements to $\mathcal{O}(d n^{2/d})$, but quickly becomes
  intractable when the dimension exceeds a few dozen. Recent work has shown that pairings
  certain low discrepancy sequences with special kernels enables GPR to scale like
  $\mathcal{O}(n \log n + nd)$ for fitting costs and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for storage
  requirements. We describe an extension of these methods to problems which observe
  $m$ derivative multi-indices at each of the $n$ low discrepancy sampling locations.
  By exploiting similar structure across blocks of the Gram matrix, we are able to
  reduce the GP fitting cost from $\mathcal{O}(n^3 m^3 + n^2m^2d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m^2
  n \log n+m^3n + n m^2 d)$ and reduce the storage requirements from $\mathcal{O}(n^2
  m^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$. We explore a number of synthetic benchmarks to illustrate
  the potential of the proposed approach.
