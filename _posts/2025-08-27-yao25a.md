title: Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical
  ODE Solvers
abstract: Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient
  methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical
  applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain
  parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature,
  do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this
  limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical
  quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for
  both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across
  multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates
  closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty
  from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty
  estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that
  probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric
  uncertainty in dynamical systems.
