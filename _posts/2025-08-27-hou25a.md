title: Online Conformal Probabilistic Numerics via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Offloading
abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the
  solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying
  computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver
  (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the userâ€™s query within the allotted time and
  computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions.
  Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained
  via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect
  to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to
  calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage
  requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS
  (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online
  calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an
  online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models.
  The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs
  between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.
